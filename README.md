📘 Project Title

Library Management System

✅ Overview / Description

A web-based Library Management System that allows users to manage books, borrowing, and returns.
It typically includes features for:

Adding, updating, and deleting books

Registering library members

Issuing books to members

Returning books

Viewing reports/stats (e.g. which books are currently issued)

This project is structured in a client-server architecture (frontend + backend).

🏗️ Architecture & Tech Stack
Layer / Component	Technology / Framework	Description
Frontend (client)	(e.g. React / Vue / plain HTML/JS/CSS)	The UI through which users interact
Backend (server)	(e.g. Node.js/Express, Django, Flask, etc.)	The API & business logic
Database	(e.g. MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL)	Stores information about books, users, transactions
Communication	REST API / JSON	Between frontend and backend

You can mention the specific frameworks, libraries, and versions you used (e.g. “Express v4.17.1”, “React 18”, etc.).
